Hi all,

As I learn more this month I am sure that my ideas or what I have decided to do at this point my change but for now check out my answers to the following questions.
</p>
 
<p>
1. Since I am assuming we are also using the Phonegap framework I can pretty much implement all of the native device features like the camera, geolocation, accelerometer and alerts.
</p>
 
<p>
2. For my CRUD app revision I think I am most likely to implement the camera and geolocation functiions since my app is a guest list and event planning app.  These will come in handy.
</p>
 
<p>
3. Past lessons learned regarding my workflow I would have to say is that I really have to map out a game plan on how to tackle my projects before I start them.  i have the tendancy to practice two really bad habits, I am either all over the place working on everything at once, not getting anything done or I am stuck on one problem and waste a lot of time trying to figure it out instead of dropping it and moving on and coming back to it later.  I need a predetermined amount of time I can agree with myself to work on a problem before I drop it and move on to something else before coming back to it.   It is also pretty evident that I will need to do a lot of research moving forward in the program.  I need a better researching method.  Also, I need to make sure I allow myself time to familarize myself with the different programs/software we use for the projects because I have a tendancy to feel completely overwhelmed if not.
</p>
 
<p>
4. My intentions for the Landing page is to make it completely different from my CRUD APP.  I want a fun, clean look that is designed with a great layout and a few CSS3 tricks that really make it stand out.  I am planning to also clean up my CRUD app as well there are a few things that need some work that could make it look better.
</p>
 
<p>
5.  My intentions for functionality in my RSVP App is to incorporate the camera to take shots of guests as an option when creating guest lists or snapping pictures of event locations.  Also, geolocation will be nice sinc ethe app will store guest and event location addresses.
